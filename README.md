# Pizza Mama (Kivy)

## About the project (V1)

## About the project (V2)

The idea is to use that API rest I made before, to 'populate' my app with datas from the original website.
I also added a way to populate the app offline, with a copy of the server's content.
So you can access the pizza list even if you are not online. And it updates  the list if there are changes on the server.
